      <title>Fixed Width Formats in R</title>
      <link>/notes/fixed-width-format-r/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) collects &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm&#34;&gt;vital statistics&lt;/a&gt; (mortality and natality) and hosts these for public use. These data can be accessed via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wonder.cdc.gov/&#34;&gt;web-based query builder&lt;/a&gt; or by download. The files are available as zip archives, and when uncompressed contain tabular data with observations stored in fixed width format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post documents the steps I took to prepare the 2016 CDC national natality data for an analysis in R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to download the data necessary. In this case, I was interested in 2016 statistics. But it’s worth pointing out that the data for births in the United States was collected and is available for public use all the way back to 1968. This data is collated from standard birth certificates, so some fields may vary across years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After downloading the zip file (133MB) and extracting the archive, the key step for me was reading the fixed width format into R. These data are tidy in the sense that each observation is stored in a row, and each feature in a column. But unlike some other tabular formats, there isn’t a standard separator between columns. Instead data must be parsed by the position (start and stop) of the column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read data from this format into R as a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;read.fwf&lt;/code&gt;. Alternatively, the &lt;code&gt;readr&lt;/code&gt; package has the &lt;code&gt;read_fwf()&lt;/code&gt; function, which is what I chose to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC provides a &lt;a href=&#34;ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/DVS/natality/UserGuide2016.pdf&#34;&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt; with documentation on the length, order, possible values and names for each column in the corresponding datasets. After looking through the files for the fields I needed, I put together a query for only the columns of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(readr)

births2016 &amp;lt;-
  read_fwf(births2016&amp;quot;Nat2016PublicUS.c20170517.r20170913.txt&amp;quot;,
           fwf_positions(start = c(75,490,521),
                         end = c(76,491,521),
                         col_names = c(&amp;quot;maternal_age&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;ega&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;antibiotics&amp;quot;)
                         )
           )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to read in all of the columns, you could use &lt;code&gt;fwf_empty()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;fwf_positions&lt;/code&gt; in the call to &lt;code&gt;read_fwf()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;births2016 &amp;lt;-
  read_fwf(&amp;quot;Nat2016PublicUS.c20170517.r20170913.txt&amp;quot;,
           fwf_empty(&amp;quot;Nat2016PublicUS.c20170517.r20170913.txt&amp;quot;)
           )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind &lt;code&gt;fwf_empty&lt;/code&gt; can accommodate a “col_names” argument as well. But in this case there would be &amp;gt; 100 column names to provide, some of which are “filler” according to the dataset documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side project I recently helped a &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt; use an &lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BIEN&#34;&gt;R package&lt;/a&gt; for retrieving data from the Botantical Information and Ecology Network Database (BIEN). The code / output for that exploration is documented below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;BIEN&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;leaflet&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;rgdal&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;geojsonio&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;htmltools&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;knitr&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(BIEN)
library(leaflet)
library(rgdal)
library(geojsonio)
library(dplyr)
library(htmltools)
library(knitr)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;occurrence&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Occurrence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIEN includes occurence data on the species level. The code below queries the database for Western Sumac (&lt;em&gt;Rhus copallanium&lt;/em&gt;) and returns an interactive map with markers for all of the places where the species has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# retrieve occurrenc data for western sumac
wsumac &amp;lt;- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = &amp;quot;Rhus copallinum&amp;quot;)

# plot points on map
# popups for date collected where available
leaflet(data = wsumac) %&amp;gt;%
  addProviderTiles(&amp;quot;OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  addCircleMarkers(lng=wsumac$longitude,

&lt;p&gt;BIEN has species lists on state level as well. After retrieving lists of species for each of the states in the USA … we can count the number of species, and map the distribution of counts by State. This might provide a visual idea of plant diversity across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOLAweb&lt;/code&gt; is an interactive application that implements functions from the LOLA package in a web interface via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://shiny.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shiny&lt;/a&gt; framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is hosted and available for use at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lolaweb.databio.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://lolaweb.databio.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run the application locally, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to first clone this repository:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/databio/LOLAweb.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app requires R to be installed, as well as several packages. From within R run the following to install the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(c(&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;shiny&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DT&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;shinyWidgets&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;shinyjs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sodium&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;shinyBS&amp;quot;))
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;databio/simpleCache&amp;quot;)
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;databio/GenomicDistributions&amp;quot;)

source(&amp;quot;https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&amp;quot;)
biocLite(c(&amp;quot;LOLA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;GenomicRanges&amp;quot;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also need underlying data that is not available in this repository in order to establish the universes, example user sets and reference genome directories. Run the following from within the root of this folder to download the data and create the &lt;code&gt;universes/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;userSets/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reference/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cache/&lt;/code&gt; directories respectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create universes dir
mkdir universes
mkdir userSets

# example universe and user set
curl http://cloud.databio.org.s3.amazonaws.com/vignettes/lola_vignette_data_150505.tgz | tar xvz

mv lola_vignette_data/activeDHS_universe.bed universes/.
mv lola_vignette_data/setB_100.bed userSets/.

rm -rf lola_vignette_data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create reference dir
mkdir reference

# core
curl http://cloud.databio.org.s3.amazonaws.com/regiondb/LOLACoreCaches_170206.tgz | tar xvz
mv scratch/ns5bc/resources/regions/LOLACore reference/Core
rm -rf scratch

# extended
curl http://cloud.databio.org.s3.amazonaws.com/regiondb/LOLAExtCaches_170206.tgz | tar xvz
mv scratch/ns5bc/resources/regions/LOLAExt reference/Extended
rm -rf scratch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create cache dir
mkdir cache
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of the above installed you can now launch the app with &lt;code&gt;shiny::runApp()&lt;/code&gt; from within R at the root of this directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-the-package&#34;&gt;Installing the package&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install the current stable, CRAN version of the package, type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;epicontacts&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To benefit from the latest features and bug fixes, install the development, &lt;em&gt;github&lt;/em&gt; version of the package using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;reconhub/epicontacts&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this requires the package &lt;em&gt;devtools&lt;/em&gt; installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-it-do&#34;&gt;What does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of the package include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; a new S3 class for storing linelists and contacts data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;make_epicontacts&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; a constructor for the new &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_id&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; access unique IDs in an &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; with various options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_pairwise&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: extract attributes of record(s) in contacts database using
information provided in the linelist data of an &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_degree&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; access degree of cases in &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; with various options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;x[i,j,contacts]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; subset an &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; object by retaining specified
cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;thin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; retains matching cases in linelist / contacts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; summary for &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; plot for &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; objects; various types of plot are
available; default to &lt;code&gt;vis_epicontacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;vis_epicontacts&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; plot an &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; object using &lt;code&gt;visNetwork&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;as.igraph.epicontacts&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; create an &lt;code&gt;igraph&lt;/code&gt; object from an epicontacts object&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_clusters&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; assign clusters and corresponding cluster sizes to
linelist of an epicontacts object (clusters being groups of connected
individuals/nodes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;subset_clusters_by_id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: subset an &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; object based on a IDs of
cases of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;subset_clusters_by_size&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: subset an &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; object based on size(s)
of clusters (clusters being groups of connected individuals/nodes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;graph3D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: 3D graph from an &lt;code&gt;epicontacts&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vignettes&#34;&gt;Vignettes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of &lt;em&gt;epicontacts&lt;/em&gt; is provided below in the worked example below.
More detailed tutorials are distributed as vignettes with the package:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;vignette(&amp;quot;overview&amp;quot;, package=&amp;quot;epicontacts&amp;quot;)
vignette(&amp;quot;customize_plot&amp;quot;, package=&amp;quot;epicontacts&amp;quot;)
vignette(&amp;quot;epicontacts_class&amp;quot;, package=&amp;quot;epicontacts&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;websites&#34;&gt;Websites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following websites are available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-quick-overview&#34;&gt;A quick overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following worked example provides a brief overview of the package&amp;rsquo;s
functionalities. See the &lt;a href=&#34;#vignettes&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;vignettes section&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more detailed
tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;obtaining-an-epicontacts-object&#34;&gt;Obtaining an &lt;em&gt;epicontacts&lt;/em&gt; object&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;epicontacts&lt;/em&gt; need two types of data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;linelist&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. a spreadsheet documenting cases where columns are
variables and rows correspond to unique cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;list of edges&lt;/strong&gt;, defining connections between cases, identified by their
unique identifier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There does not need to be an one-to-one correspondance between cases documented
in the linelist and those appearing in the contacts. However, links will be made
between the two sources of data whenever unique identifiers match. This will be
especially handy when subsetting data, or when characterising contacts in terms
of &amp;lsquo;node&amp;rsquo; (case) properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We illustrate the construction of an &lt;em&gt;epicontacts&lt;/em&gt; using contact data from a
Middle East Respiratory Syndrom coronavirus (MERS CoV) from South Korea in 2015,
available as the dataset &lt;code&gt;mers_korea_2015&lt;/code&gt; in the package &lt;em&gt;outbreaks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;
library(outbreaks)
library(epicontacts)

names(mers_korea_2015)
#&amp;gt; [1] &amp;quot;linelist&amp;quot; &amp;quot;contacts&amp;quot;

#&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt;   // attributes in contacts:
#&amp;gt;  exposure diff_dt_onset
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the linelist and contacts will usually be imported from a text file
(e.g. .txt, .csv) or a spreadsheet (e.g. .ods, .xls) using usual import
functions (e.g. &lt;code&gt;read.table&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;read.csv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gdata::read.xls&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;simple-analyses&#34;&gt;Simple analyses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we plot the &lt;em&gt;epicontacts&lt;/em&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;
plot(x, selector = FALSE)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/reconhub/epicontacts/raw/master/figs/plot_x.png&#34; width=&#34;600px&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot of the actual plot. For interactive graphs, see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/articles/epicontacts.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;introductory vignette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can look for patterns of contacts between genders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;
plot(x, &amp;quot;sex&amp;quot;, col_pal = spectral)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/reconhub/epicontacts/raw/master/figs/plot_x_gender.png&#34; width=&#34;600px&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no obvious signs of non-random mixing patterns, but this is worth
testing. The function &lt;code&gt;get_pairwise&lt;/code&gt; is particularly useful for this. In its
basic form, it reports nodes of attributes for all contacts. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;
get_pairwise(x, attribute = &amp;quot;sex&amp;quot;)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one can specify the function to be used to compare the attributes of
connected nodes; for instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;
sex_tab &amp;lt;- get_pairwise(x, attribute = &amp;quot;sex&amp;quot;, f = table)
sex_tab
#&amp;gt;            values.to
#&amp;gt; values.from  F  M
#&amp;gt;           F  2  4
#&amp;gt;           M 38 54
fisher.test(sex_tab)
#&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt; 	Fisher&#39;s Exact Test for Count Data
#&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt; data:  sex_tab
#&amp;gt; p-value = 1
#&amp;gt; alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1
#&amp;gt; 95 percent confidence interval:
#&amp;gt;  0.06158088 5.26628732
#&amp;gt; sample estimates:
#&amp;gt; odds ratio 
#&amp;gt;   0.712926
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there are no patterns of association between genders.  We can also use
this function to compute delays between dates. For instance, to get the
distribution of the serial interval (delay between primary and secondary onset):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;
si &amp;lt;- get_pairwise(x, attribute = &amp;quot;dt_onset&amp;quot;)
si
#&amp;gt;  [1] 10 13 14 14 15 15 15 16 16 16 17 18 18 18 18 19 19 19 20 20 20 21 21

#&amp;gt;    2.00   11.00   14.00   14.47   18.00   27.00
hist(si, col = &amp;quot;grey&amp;quot;, border = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, nclass = 30, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Time to secondary onset (days)&amp;quot;, 
     main = &amp;quot;Distribution of the serial interval&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of &lt;strong&gt;hei&lt;/strong&gt; is to calculate Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for use in dietary analyses. The HEI is a dietary metric designed by the USDA and NCI to gauge adherence to the US Dietary Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hei&lt;/strong&gt; is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=hei&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;, and can be installed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;hei&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install the development version hosted on this repository, use the &lt;strong&gt;devtools&lt;/strong&gt; package and the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;)
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;timfolsom/hei&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(hei)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;hei&lt;/strong&gt; package contains one key function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hei()&lt;/code&gt; takes as its arguments three data sets: an FPED data set, a NHANES dietary data set, and an NHANES demographic data set, returning a HEI score for each individual in the NHANES study being analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hei&lt;/strong&gt; also includes &lt;code&gt;get_fped()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;get_diet()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_demo()&lt;/code&gt; for retrieving data from the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) and the NHANES dietary and demographic databases, respectively. The FPED data sets (in the public domain) retrieved by &lt;code&gt;get_fped()&lt;/code&gt; are built into the package and have been converted to .csv files from the SAS data format in which they were originally published by their creators. &lt;code&gt;get_diet()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_demo()&lt;/code&gt; require the R package &lt;code&gt;nhanesA&lt;/code&gt; which is employed to retrieve NHANES data sets directly from the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;related-work&#34;&gt;Related Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hei&lt;/strong&gt; is intended as a tool to aid in the analysis of NHANES data. It is important to be familiar with NHANES and its complex survey design as well as the FPED, which is derived from NHANES, before beginning any analyses involving the HEI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openrefine.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (formerly &lt;em&gt;Google Refine&lt;/em&gt;) is a popular, open source data cleaning software. &lt;strong&gt;rrefine&lt;/strong&gt; enables users to programmatically trigger data transfer between R and &lt;em&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/em&gt;. Using the functions available in this package, you can import, export or delete a project in &lt;em&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/em&gt; directly from R. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Documentation-For-Developers#known-client-libraries-for-refine&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;several client libraries for automating &lt;em&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/em&gt; tasks via Python, nodeJS and Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;rrefine&lt;/strong&gt; extends this functionality to R users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of &lt;strong&gt;rrefine&lt;/strong&gt; is availabe on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vpnagraj/rrefine&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and can be installed via &lt;strong&gt;devtools&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;)
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;vpnagraj/rrefine&amp;quot;)
library(rrefine)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rrefine&lt;/strong&gt; is also available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rrefine/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;rrefine&amp;quot;)
library(rrefine)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;functions&#34;&gt;Functions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package includes the following functionality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;refine_upload()&lt;/code&gt; (upload data to &lt;em&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/em&gt; from R)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;refine_export()&lt;/code&gt; (export data to R from &lt;em&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;refine_delete()&lt;/code&gt; (delete &lt;em&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/em&gt; project)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptions and examples of usage are available in the package &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rrefine/rrefine.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rrefine/vignettes/rrefine-vignette.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; is an R package providing functions for caching R objects. Its
purpose is to encourage writing reusable, restartable, and reproducible analysis
pipelines for projects with massive data and computational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its name indicates, &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; is intended to be simple. You choose a
location to store your caches, and then provide the function with nothing more
than a cache name and instructions (R code) for how to produce the R object.
While simple, &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; also provides some advanced options like environment
assignments, recreating caches, reloading caches, and even cluster compute
bindings (using the &lt;code&gt;batchtools&lt;/code&gt; package) making it flexible enough for use in
large-scale data analysis projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;installing-simplecache&#34;&gt;Installing simpleCache&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; is on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=simpleCache&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt; and can
be installed as usual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;simpleCache&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-simplecache&#34;&gt;Running simpleCache&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; comes with a single primary function (&lt;code&gt;simpleCache()&lt;/code&gt;) that will do almost
everything you need. In short, you run it with a few lines like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(simpleCache) 
setCacheDir(tempdir())
simpleCache(&amp;quot;normSample&amp;quot;, { rnorm(1e7, 0,1) }, recreate=TRUE)
simpleCache(&amp;quot;normSample&amp;quot;, { rnorm(1e7, 0,1) })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; also interfaces with the &lt;code&gt;batchtools&lt;/code&gt; package to let you build
caches on any cluster resource manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;simpleCache()&lt;/code&gt;: Creates and caches or reloads cached results of provided R instruction code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;listCaches()&lt;/code&gt;: Lists all of the caches available in the &lt;code&gt;cacheDir&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;deleteCaches()&lt;/code&gt;: Deletes cache(s) from the &lt;code&gt;cacheDir&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;setCacheDir()&lt;/code&gt;: Sets a global option for a cache directory so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to specify one in each &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;simpleCacheOptions()&lt;/code&gt;: Views all of the &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; global options that have been set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;simplecache-philosophy&#34;&gt;simpleCache Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use case I had in mind for &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; is that you find yourself
constantly recalculating the same R object in several different scripts, or
repeatedly in the same script, every time you open it and want to continue that
project. SimpleCache is well-suited for interactive analysis, allowing you to
pick up right where you left off in a new R session, without having to
recalculate everything. It is equally useful in automatic pipelines, where
separate scripts may benefit from loading, instead of recalculating, the same R
objects produced by other scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R provides some base functions (&lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;serialize&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt;) to let you save
and reload such objects, but these low-level functions are a bit cumbersome.
&lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; simply provides a convenient, user-friendly interface to these
functions, streamlining the process. For example, a single &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; call
will check for a cache and load it if it exists, or create it if it does not.
With the base R &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; functions, you can&amp;rsquo;t just write a single
function call and then run the same thing every time you start the script &amp;ndash;
even this simple use case requires additional logic to check for an existing
cache. &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; just does all this for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing to keep in mind with &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; is that &lt;strong&gt;the cache name is
paramount&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;code&gt;simpleCache&lt;/code&gt; assumes that your name for an object is a perfect
identifier for that object; in other words, don&amp;rsquo;t cache things that you plan to
change.&lt;/p&gt;
