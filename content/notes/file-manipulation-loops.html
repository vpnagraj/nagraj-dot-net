summary: "comparing bash and R for iterative file manipulation"

<p>When performing repetitive file manipulation operations, it can be useful to write a loop.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you have a file structure organized as follows:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>.
+-- loop.sh
+-- loop.R
+-- raw
|   +-- sample1.bed
|   +-- sample2.bed
|   +-- sample3.bed
|   +-- sample4.bed
|   +-- sample5.bed
+-- processed
|   +-- </code></pre>
<p>You’d like to loop through all of the <code>.bed</code> files in the <code>raw/</code> directory, and output the first and last columns in a <code>.csv</code> file in the <code>processed/</code> directory that shares the same file prefix (i.e. “sample1”) as the given input.</p>
<p>To do so you could write a bash script that is in a file called <code>loop.sh</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>#!/bin/bash

# loop through all .bed files in the raw dir
FILES=raw/*.bed

for f in $FILES

do
  # message
  printf &quot;\n%s\n%s\n&quot; &quot;processing $f ...&quot; &quot;------------------------------&quot;

  # get input file name ...
  # ... and create output file based on that
  in_fn=$(basename -- &quot;$f&quot;)
  out_fn=&quot;${in_fn%.*}&quot;

  # use awk to get first and last columns  ...
  # ... pipe output to csv format
  awk &#39;BEGIN{FS=&quot;\t&quot;;OFS=&quot;,&quot;}{print $1, $NF}&#39; $f &gt; processed/&quot;$out_fn&quot;.csv

done</code></pre>
<p>And in <code>loop.R</code> you could write something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>files &lt;- list.files(&quot;raw&quot;, full.names = TRUE)

for (f in files) {
  
  bed &lt;- read.delim(f, sep = &quot;\t&quot;)
  
  out_fp &lt;- paste0(&quot;processed/&quot;, 
                   tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(f)),
                   &quot;.csv&quot;)
  
  write.csv(bed[,c(1,ncol(bed))], row.names = FALSE, file = out_fp)
  
}</code></pre>
<p>Both of the above should work and yield the following:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>.
+-- loop.sh
+-- loop.R
+-- raw
|   +-- sample1.bed
|   +-- sample2.bed
|   +-- sample3.bed
|   +-- sample4.bed
|   +-- sample5.bed
+-- processed
|   +-- sample1.csv
|   +-- sample2.csv
|   +-- sample3.csv
|   +-- sample4.csv
|   +-- sample5.csv</code></pre>
<p>However, your choice of method could have serious performance implications.</p>
<p>I tested this on dummy files that were roughly 100MB each (~ 2.5 million rows, 4 columns).</p>
<p>The R method took ~ 90 seconds … the bash script finished in 30 seconds.</p>
