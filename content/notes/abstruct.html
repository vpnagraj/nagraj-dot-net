<p>Just spent ~ 90 minutes this morning toying with the text generation program I mentioned in <a href="http://vpnagraj.github.io/notes/dadadodo/">a note</a> yesterday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jwz.org/dadadodo/"><em>dadadodo</em></a> automatically creates pseudo random output based on input text. It’s a command line utility, and I have it installed on a Linux machine. Since I have a Shiny server running on the same box, I figured I’d see if I could combine the two and create a web app:</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.bioconnector.virginia.edu/abstruct/" class="uri">http://apps.bioconnector.virginia.edu/abstruct/</a></p>
<p><em>abstruct</em> uses an R interface for the Pubmed API through the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rentrez/vignettes/rentrez_tutorial.html">rentrez</a> package to search for abstracts based on user input keywords. This premise depends on <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/policy/structured_abstracts.html">structured abstracts</a>, which the National Library of Medicine indexes granularly (down to “Objectives”, “Results”, etc.) and exposes in the XML export for each record. The app crawls through X number of records that meet the search term (and have structured abstracts), then parses the XML for each section and passes a concatenated file to <em>dadadodo</em> for babbling via the R <code>system()</code> function.</p>
<p>The results are stored in a single variable that is accessed separately in each Shiny output object by using <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson6/">reactive</a> elements.</p>
