> tmux is a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same time. It can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals, allowing SSH sessions to remain active without being visible.[^1]

There are a lot of great cheatsheets, demos, and resources for how to use `tmux`[^2][^3][^4]. 

In general `tmux` can help manage three components: 

- sessions
- windows
- panes

What follows will be a series of commands that starts a session with `ping`, the `tmux` clock, and `htop` running with the pane layout customized to look like the following:

Start a new tmux session called "demo":

`tmux new-session -s demo`

Start running ping:

`ping stackoverflow.com`

Split vertically to create a second pane:

`ctrl-b` +  `%`

Start the big clock:

`ctrl-b` + `t`

Split horizontally to create a third pane:

`ctrl-b` + `"`

Do something else (in this case open htop):

`htop`

Resize the pane beneath the clock:

`ctrl-b` + `:resize-pane -U 5`

Remove the pane beneath the clock:

`ctrl-b` + `x` + `y`

Detach from the session:

`ctrl-b` + `:detach`

Kill the session altogether:

`tmux kill-session -t demo`
