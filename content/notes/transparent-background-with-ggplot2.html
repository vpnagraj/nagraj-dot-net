<p>While I was preparing a figure for a research poster recently, I ran into an issue: my poster had an off-white background but the figure had a white background.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to mind was making the plot background transparent. Should be easy enough?</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7455046/how-to-make-graphics-with-transparent-background-in-r-using-ggplot2">It is.</a></p>
<p>The gist is that you need to set the both panel and <em>and</em> plot backgrounds to transparent. It’s probably a good idea to “turn off” the grid elements since otherwise they will default to a color. All of the above can be done with options via the <code>theme()</code> function.</p>
<p>And when saving the plot with <code>ggsave()</code> you also should indicate that the background is transparent.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
data(&quot;airquality&quot;)

p &lt;- 
    ggplot(airquality, aes(Solar.R, Temp)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth() +
    # set transparency
    theme(
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;transparent&quot;,colour = NA),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;transparent&quot;,colour = NA)
        )

p</code></pre>
