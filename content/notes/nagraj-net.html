summary: "custom domain for this github pages site"
---



<p>Not sure why I’ve been putting it off but I finally added a custom domain for this site, which is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Once I settled on ‘nagraj.net’ I started looking for domain services. <a href="https://domains.google.com/about/">Google Domains</a> had the name available at a reasonable price, and I found <a href="http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/">really good documentation that spells out exactly how to configure a Github Pages site to use a domain purchased via Google Domains</a>.</p>
<p>If and when I have to buy, register and configure a custom domain name for a Github Pages site again, I’ll probably refer to the <a href="http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/">really good documentation that spells out exactly how to configure a Github Pages site to use a domain purchased via Google Domains</a> … and I’ll know ahead of time that the process is fairly simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy the domain (Google Domains)</li>
<li>Create the Github Pages site (Github)</li>
<li>Add a CNAME file with the custom domain to the site directory root (Github)</li>
<li>Register the IP addresses for Github (Google Domains)</li>
<li>Register the CNAME for the site repo (Google Domains)</li>
<li>Wait for the DNS magic to happen (Wherever The DNS Magic Happens)</li>
</ul>
