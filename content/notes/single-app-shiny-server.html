<p>If you’ve written a Shiny app and have reached a point where you would like to share it with others … you have a few options:</p>
<p><a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/" class="uri">https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/</a></p>
<p>Given that you have hardware (or a cloud setup) to install a server, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/">Shiny Server Open Source</a> may be a good solution.</p>
<p>I’ve deployed dozens of apps on different Shiny servers. In some cases, I may need a single server that hosts an entire directory of apps. With this configuration (the default for Shiny Server Open Source) each app is available at {url}/{app-name}.</p>
<p>However, I occassionally want a server to host a single application that will be available at {url}. In this case, I just need to adjust a few parameters in server configuration. Below is an example <code>shiny-server.conf</code> file for an app called “prod” that lives in <code>/srv/shiny-server/prod</code> on the host machine:</p>
<pre><code># Define the user we should use when spawning R Shiny processes
run_as shiny;

# disable idle timeout to retain connection
app_idle_timeout 0;

# Define a top-level server which will listen on a port
server {
  # Instruct this server to listen on port 80. The app at dokku-alt need expose PORT 80, or 500 e etc. See the docs
  listen 80;

  # Define the location available at the base URL
  location / {

    # Run this location in &#39;site_dir&#39; mode, which hosts the entire directory
    # tree at &#39;/srv/shiny-server&#39;
    app_dir /srv/shiny-server/prod;
    
    # Define where we should put the log files for this location
    log_dir /var/log/shiny-server;
    
    # Should we list the contents of a (non-Shiny-App) directory when the user 
    # visits the corresponding URL?
    directory_index on;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that the parameters of interest for this post are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>listen</code> … explicitly tell the server to <code>listen 80</code> so that apps are served at port 80 … otherwise you’ll need to specify the port number after the url (i.e. {url}:3737)</li>
<li><code>location</code> … we don’t want to pass any special location to the base URL since we’re defining an <code>app_dir</code> (see below) … so <code>location /</code> should work fine</li>
<li><code>app_dir</code> … rather than serving up an entire directory of apps, we just have one … make sure the <code>app_dir</code> specifies the directory where the app is on the host machine (usually <code>/srv/shiny-server/{app-name}</code>)</li>
</ul>
