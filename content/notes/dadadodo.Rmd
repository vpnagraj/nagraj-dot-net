[dadadodo](https://www.jwz.org/dadadodo/) is a commmad line utilitiy for creating (pseudo) random sentencesâ€“and it was mentioned in the documentaiton for one of the datasets I wrote about in the [last post](notes/free-data/).

The name is a nod to the nonsensical, and some times the *dadadodo* output feels truly [postmodern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs). The program is built on a [Markov model](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/assignments/markov.html) but can generate some pretty wild results, especially with a larger corpus. 

That said, it's easy to install and run from the command line.

On a Linux machine `sudo apt-get install dadadodo` followed by `man dadadodo` will run the install and then pull up the documentation.

As the man will tell you, the output can be configured by number of sentences with the `-c` option. So if you're passing the program a txt file that has the complete works of William Blake and you want to create one sentence, then your code might look something like `dadadodo -c 1 blake.txt`
