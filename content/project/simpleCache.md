# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "R package that provides intuitive functions for caching R objects, encouraging reproducible, restartable, and distributed R analysis. The user selects a location to store caches, and then provides nothing more than a cache name and instructions (R code) for how to produce the R object. Also provides some advanced options like environment assignments, recreating or reloading caches, and cluster compute bindings (using the 'batchtools' package) making it flexible enough for use in large-scale data analysis projects."
